# Abagard.pl Website
The abagard.pl project is a testament to successful web design and effective SEO strategy. Created for Abagard, a local tiling service business based in Pozna≈Ñ, this website significantly improved the company's visibility on Google.

## Context
Faced with the challenges of inflation and the impacts of war in Ukraine, Abagard experienced a notable decrease in orders. I was tasked with implementing the website and conducting SEO activities to enhance the company's online presence and attract new customers.

## Outcome
Thanks to modern design and effective positioning on Google, Abagard is now experiencing a renaissance, with work scheduled for half a year in advance. The company now acquires customers not through recommendations as before, but through internet searches.
